## About the Project

**CoffeeAgntcy** is a reference implementation based on a fictitious coffee company to help developers understand how components in the **AGNTCY Internet of Agents** ecosystem can work together. It gives examples of the components of AGNTCY working together as a **Multi-agent System (MAS)**. 

This reference agentic application demonstrates how to:

- How **SLIM** enables **request-reply** and **unicast (fire & forget)** patterns
- How tools and transports can be reused across agent implementations (e.g., **SLIM**, **NATS**, **MCP**)
- How protocol-agnostic bridges and clients interconnect modular agents
- How to orchestrate agents using **LangGraph** for structured and stateful workflows
- How to write **A2A** client and server agents
- How to integrate data sources (e.g., weather services via **MCP**)
- How to extend or swap agents modularly using AGNTCY tooling
- How to enable observability using **AGNTCY Observe SDK**
- How to enable identity using **AGNTCY Identity SDK**

### Setups Included

We currently provide two setups you can run to see how components from AGNTCY work together — one simple two-agent use case and the other a more complex MAS:

- **Corto**:  
  A two-agent, ready-to-run setup that highlights core agent interactions using agent-to-agent (A2A) messaging via configurable transports(default: AGNTCY's SLIM). Agents are orchestrated within a LangGraph. It also shows how to enable observability using Observe SDK.

  👉 [View the Corto README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/corto)

- **Lungo**:  
  A more advanced setup that will evolve over time as we mature components. The first release shows agents that use A2A communication via configurable transports (default: SLIM), are structured as directed LangGraphs, and include an MCP weather-aware farm that fetches live data. It also shows how to enable observability using Observe SDK.
