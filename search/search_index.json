It gives examples of the components of AGNTCY working together as a Multi-agent System (MAS) . This project is ideal for developers building agent-based systems and looking to explore: How SLIM enables broadcast and unicast messaging How tools and transports can be reused across agent implementations (e.g., SLIM , NATS , MCP ) How protocol-agnostic bridges and clients interconnect modular agents How to orchestrate agents using LangGraph for structured and stateful workflows How to write A2A client and server agents How to integrate data sources (e.g., weather services via MCP ) How to extend or swap agents modularly using AGNTCY tooling How to enable observability using AGNTCY Observe SDK Setups Included We currently provide two setups you can run to see how components from AGNTCY work together \u2014 one simple two-agent use case and the other a more complex MAS: Corto : A two-agent, ready-to-run setup that highlights core agent interactions using agent-to-agent (A2A) messaging via configurable transports(default: AGNTCY's SLIM). Agents are orchestrated within a LangGraph. It also shows how to enable observability using Observe SDK. \ud83d\udc49 View the Corto README Lungo : A more advanced setup that will evolve over time as we mature components. The first release shows agents that use A2A communication via configurable transports (default: SLIM), are structured as directed LangGraphs, and include an MCP weather-aware farm that fetches live data. It also shows how to enable observability using Observe SDK. \ud83d\udc49 View the Lungo README Built With AGNTCY App SDK = v0.1.4 SLIM = v0.3.15 A2A = v0.2.5 MCP >= v1.10.0 LangGraph >= v0.4.1 Observe SDK = 1.0.12 Contributing This is a developer-facing reference repo. If you're building agentic systems\u2014or interested in shaping the future of distributed agents\u2014we'd love your feedback, contributions, or collaboration.

Scope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at oss-conduct@cisco.com . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Enforcement Guidelines Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct: 1. Correction Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. 4.

Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to review. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the contributors managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. In that spirit of mutual respect, we endeavor to review incoming issues and pull requests within 10 days, and will close any lingering issues or pull requests after 60 days of inactivity. Please note that all of your interactions in the project are subject to our Code of Conduct . This includes creation of issues or pull requests, commenting on issues or pull requests, and extends to all interactions in any real-time space e.g., Slack, Discord, etc. Reporting Issues Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or fixed by searching through our issues list . When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a title and clear description , as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a test case. If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub. Instead, please see security procedures in SECURITY.md . Sending Pull Requests Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or if the change was already implemented but not yet released. We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as we follow semantic versioning, we may reserve breaking changes until the next major version release. Other Ways to Contribute We welcome anyone that wants to contribute to coffeeAgntcy to triage and reply to open issues to help troubleshoot and fix existing bugs. Here is what you can do: Help ensure that existing issues follows the recommendations from the Reporting Issues section, providing feedback to the issue's author on what might be missing. Review existing pull requests, and testing patches against real existing applications that use coffeeAgntcy . Write a test, or add a missing test case to an existing test.
